    <h1>Berani – Child Safety & CSAE Standards</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 24 Aug 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Berani</strong> is an anti-bullying reporting tool. We have a zero-tolerance policy toward
      child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE) and any content that sexualizes minors.</p>

    <h2>Scope & Zero-Tolerance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Berani does not host public user-generated content or social feeds.</li>
      <li>Any imagery a user selects is used only to compile a private report on their device unless the user chooses to share it.</li>
      <li>We strictly prohibit CSAM, sexualized depictions of minors, grooming, sexual extortion, or trading of imagery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Berani Handles Images</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Images are accessed <em>only</em> when a user explicitly selects them through the system photo picker.</li>
      <li>Images are shown in the report preview and stored in the user’s private Vault if they choose to save.</li>
      <li>If the user requests an AI summary, only the data necessary to generate the summary is transmitted securely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Detection, Reporting & Cooperation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If we become aware of suspected CSAM through in-app reports, support channels, or lawful requests, we will preserve
          relevant information and report to appropriate authorities. For U.S. matters, we report to the
          National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) CyberTipline.</li>
      <li>We cooperate with law enforcement subject to applicable laws and due process.</li>
      <li><strong>If anyone is in immediate danger, contact local emergency services immediately.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User Guidance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Berani only to document incidents you have a lawful right to report.</li>
      <li>Do not upload, share, or circulate illegal content. Instead, report suspected CSAM directly to the authorities.</li>
      <li>Share reports only with trusted adults, safeguarding leads, or relevant officials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy, Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reports remain on the device unless you choose to share them.</li>
      <li>Users can delete images and reports from the Vault at any time.</li>
      <li>We minimize data collection and retain only what is necessary for support or legal compliance.</li>
    </ul>
